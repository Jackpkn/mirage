/**
 * Map one local filesystem notification onto mount paths.
 *
 * Mirage runs no watcher of its own: the consumer owns the inotify / FSEvents
 * / ReadDirectoryChangesW loop (chokidar, `fs.watch`, or the raw syscall) and
 * forwards what it saw, which keeps the dependency out of the package and lets
 * a deployment pick its own mechanism.
 *
 * `eventType` is one of `created`, `modified`, `deleted` or `moved`, so a
 * consumer translates its library's spelling once (chokidar's `add`/`addDir`
 * are `created`, `unlink`/`unlinkDir` are `deleted`, `change` is `modified`).
 * Any other name maps to nothing, because a watcher reports events this mount
 * has no opinion about.
 *
 * `payload` carries the host absolute paths the event named:
 * `{src_path, dest_path, is_directory}`. Those are watchdog's own field names,
 * taken verbatim from `FileSystemEvent` so the two languages accept the same
 * body and a python consumer can forward an event as a dict without renaming.
 *
 * Mirrors Python `DiskEventHook` (`core/disk/watch/hook.py`).
