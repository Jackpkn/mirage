 * `a A i l n r t u x`: `a`/`A` first, then `i n r t x`, then `l`/`u`. It
 * is bash's own internal order, not the order the letters were typed in
 * (`declare -xri` prints `-irx`), and not alphabetical.
 *
 * `-a` and `-A` are deliberately absent: whether a variable is an
 * indexed array, an associative array or a scalar is what its value
 * *is*, so storing it a second time as an attribute would let the two
 * contradict each other. `attrLetters` derives them from the value.

 * leaves nothing half-applied. Making the record immutable turns that
 * convention into something the type enforces: the only way to change a
 * variable is to hand the door a new record, so a policy gate cannot be
 * walked around by reaching into storage.
 *
 * `value` is null in bash's third state: declared with attributes but
 * *unset*, which `readonly NAME` and `export NAME` on a fresh name both
 * produce. It is not the empty string -- GNU prints `declare -r ONLY`
 * for one and `declare -r EMPTY=""` for the other, `${ONLY-d}` expands
 * to `d` while `${EMPTY-d}` does not, and `env` carries the empty one
 * but not the unset one.
