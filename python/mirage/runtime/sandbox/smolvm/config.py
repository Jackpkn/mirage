        machine (str): name of a running machine. You start it
            yourself (`smolvm machine create --name mirage` then
            `smolvm machine start --name mirage`); the guest needs
            mirage installed and the workspace served at the host's
            mount prefixes. Named explicitly rather than leaning on
            smolvm's own "default" machine, so a line never lands in
            a VM the config did not choose.
